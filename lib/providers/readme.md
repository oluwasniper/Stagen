# Providers Directory

This directory contains provider classes used for state management in the application. Providers are an essential part of managing application state and data flow.

## Purpose

The providers in this directory are responsible for:

- Managing application state
- Handling data persistence
- Providing data to widgets
- Managing business logic
- Implementing dependency injection

## Usage

To use these providers:

1. Ensure they are properly registered in your app's main provider setup
2. Import the required provider in your widget
3. Access the provider using Provider.of<T>(context) or Consumer widget

## Structure

```
providers/
├── your_provider1.dart
├── your_provider2.dart
└── ...
```

## Best Practices

- Keep providers focused on specific functionality
- Implement proper state management patterns
- Use proper error handling
- Document any complex state logic
- Follow dependency injection principles

## Contributing

When adding new providers:

1. Follow the existing naming conventions
2. Add proper documentation
3. Include unit tests if applicable
4. Update this README as needed
